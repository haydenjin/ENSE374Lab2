# ENSE374Lab2

This is my completed Lab2 project for ENSE 374. 

The customizations that I added include the background changing to a random colour when a new task is added. I liked this because it mixed up the look of the whole page and itâ€™s a surprise what colour it will become next.

My other customization is when a task is complete and removed, the background becomes transparent and is replaced by a thumbs-up picture which congratulates you for completing a task.
